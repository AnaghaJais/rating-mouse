●	Integrated food inspection ratings with google places reviews for safety precautions when going to restaurants. Used the Google autocomplete feature to predict location proximity, address, and correct spelling of restaurant name. We will then display the google places rating of the restaurant along with the health inspection scores obtained from the City of Austin API.
